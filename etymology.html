            <p>The word penguin first appears in the 16th century as a synonym for great auk.[2] When European explorers discovered
            what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of
            the Northern Hemisphere, and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related.[3]</p>
            
            <p>The etymology of the word penguin is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French,[2] Breton[4] or
            Spanish[5] origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word pingouin "auk"), but first appears in English or
            Dutch.[2]</p>
            
            <p>Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, "head" and gwyn, "white",[6] including the Oxford English
            Dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary,[7] the Century Dictionary[7] and Merriam-Webster,[8] on the basis that the
            name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island (Welsh: Pen Gwyn) in
            Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black).</p>
            
            <p>An alternative etymology links the word to Latin pinguis, which means "fat" or "oil".[9] Support for this etymology can
            be found in the alternative Germanic word for penguin, Fettgans or "fat-goose", and the related Dutch word vetgans.</p>
            
            <p>Adult male penguins are called cocks, females hens; a group of penguins on land is a waddle, and a similar group in the
            water is a raft.</p>
            
            <h2>Pinguinus</h2>
            
            <p>Since 1871, the latin word Pinguinus is used in scientific classification to name the genus of a penguin called great
            auk (also known as Pinguinus impennis, meaning penguin without flight feathers),[10] which became extinct in the
            mid-19th century. As confirmed by a 2004 genetic study, the genus Pinguinus belongs in the family of the auks (Alcidae),
            within the order of the Charadriiformes.[11][12]</p>
            
            <p>The birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because of their physical
            resemblance to the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not auks and they are not closely related to
            the great auk.[3][10] Namely, they do not belong in the genus Pinguinus, and are not classified in the same family and
            order as the great auks. They were classified in 1831 by Bonaparte in several distinct genera within the family
            Spheniscidae and order Sphenisciformes.</p>
