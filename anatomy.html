            <p>Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the
            air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to bird's flight in
            the air.[41] Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate
            the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.</p>
            
            <p>All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts.[42] A
            predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin
            belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.</p>
            
            <p>Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which
            are more realistic in the case of startled flight).[citation needed] The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they
            catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in
            case of need. Dives of the large emperor penguin have been recorded reaching a depth of 565 m (1,854 ft) for up to 22
            minutes.</p>
            
            <p>Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel and
            steer themselves, a movement called "tobogganing", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both
            feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.</p>
            
            <p>Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds;[43] this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in
            crowded colonies.[44] Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and
            avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this
            hypothesis.[45]</p>
            
            <p>Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater
            than in air). The emperor penguin has a maximum feather density of about nine feathers per square centimeter which is
            actually much lower than other birds that live in antarctic environments. However, they have been identified as having
            at least four different types of feather: in addition to the traditional feather, the emperor has afterfeathers,
            plumules, and filoplumes. The afterfeathers are downy plumes that attach directly to the main feathers and were once
            believed to account for the bird's ability to conserve heat when under water; the plumules are small down feathers that
            attach directly to the skin, and are much more dense in penguins than other birds; lastly the filoplumes are small (less
            than 1 cm long) naked shafts that end in a splay of fibers— filoplumes were believed to give flying birds a sense of
            where their plumage was and whether or not it needed preening, so their presence in penguins may seem inconsistent, but
            penguins also preen extensively.[46]</p>
            
            <p>The emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat
            loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets cold, but
            still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing
            for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate
            positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the centre of the heat pack.</p>
            
            <p>Calculations of the heat loss and retention ability of marine endotherms [47] suggest that most extant penguins are too
            small to survive in such cold environments.[48] In 2007, Thomas and Fordyce wrote about the "heterothermic loophole"
            that penguins utilize in order to survive in Antarctica.[49] All extant penguins, even those that live in warmer
            climates, have a counter-current heat exchanger called the humeral plexus. The flippers of penguins have at least three
            branches of the axillary artery, which allows cold blood to be heated by blood that has already been warmed and limits
            heat loss from the flippers. This system allows penguins to efficiently use their body heat and explains why such small
            animals can survive in the extreme cold.[50]</p>
            
            <p>They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream.[51][52][53] The
            salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.</p>
            
            <p>The great auk of the Northern Hemisphere, now extinct, was superficially similar to penguins, and the word penguin was
            originally used for that bird, centuries ago. They are only distantly related to the penguins, but are an example of
            convergent evolution.[54]</p>

            Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called
            isabelline penguins. Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal
            penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep and are often passed over as mates.</p>
