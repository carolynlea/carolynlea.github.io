            <p>Penguins appear to have no special fear of humans, and will approach groups of people without hesitation. This is
            probably because penguins have no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. Dogs preyed upon penguins
            while they were allowed in Antarctica during the age of early human exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since
            been banned from Antarctica.[72] Instead, adult penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as sharks, orcas, and
            leopard seals. Typically, penguins do not approach closer than around 9 feet (3 meters), at which point they appear to
            become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are instructed to maintain between themselves and
            penguins: tourists are instructed not to approach closer than 9 feet, but need not withdraw if the penguins come closer.</p>
            
            <p>In June 2011, a penguin came ashore on New Zealand's Peka Peka Beach, 3200 km off course on its journey to
            Antarctica.[73] Nicknamed Happy Feet, after the movie of the same name, it was suffering from heat exhaustion and had to
            undergo a number of operations to remove objects like driftwood and sand from its stomach.[74] Happy Feet was a media
            sensation, with extensive coverage on TV and the web, including a live stream that had thousands of views[75] and a
            visit from English actor Stephen Fry.[76]</p>
            
            <p>Once he had recovered, Happy Feet was released back into the water south of New Zealand.[77]</p>

            <p>Penguins are popularly loved around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait, impressive swimming
            ability and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to
            a white tie suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the North Pole. This is incorrect, as
            there are no wild penguins in the Arctic. The cartoon series Chilly Willy helped perpetuate this myth, as the title
            penguin would interact with Arctic or subarctic species, such as polar bears and walruses.</p>
            
            <p>Penguins have been the subject of many books and films, such as Happy Feet, Surf's Up and The Penguins of Madagascar,
            all CGI films; March of the Penguins, a documentary based on the migration process of the emperor penguin; and a parody
            titled Farce of the Penguins. Mr. Popper's Penguins is a children's book written by Richard and Florence Atwater; it was
            named a Newbery Honor Book in 1939. Penguins have also found their way into a number of cartoons and television dramas;
            perhaps the most notable of these is Pingu, created by Silvio Mazzola in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes.
            At the end of 2009, Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Whether they were
            walking (March of the Penguins), dancing (Happy Feet), or hanging ten (Surf's Up), these oddly adorable birds took
            flight at the box office all decade long."[78]</p>
            
            <p>A video game called Pengo was released by Sega in 1982. Set in Antarctica, the player controls a penguin character who
            must navigate mazes of ice-cubes. The player is rewarded with cut-scenes of animated penguins marching, dancing,
            saluting and playing peekaboo. Several remakes and enhanced editions have followed, most recently in 2012. Penguins are
            also sometimes depicted in music.[79]</p>
            
            <p>In 1941, DC Comics introduced the avian-themed character of The Penguin as a supervillain adversary of the superhero
            Batman (Detective Comics #58). He became one of the most enduring enemies in Batman's rogue's gallery. In the 60s Batman
            TV series, as played by Burgess Meredith, he was one of the most popular characters, and in Tim Burton's reimagining of
            the character in the 1992 film Batman Returns, he employed an actual army of penguins (mostly African penguins).</p>
            
            <p>Several pro, minor, college and high school sport teams have named themselves after the species, with the Pittsburgh
            Penguins team in the National Hockey League and the Youngstown State Penguins being the most recognizable.</p>
            
            <p>The tendency of penguins to form large groups feeds the stereotype that they all look exactly alike, a popular notion
            exploited by cartoonists such as Gary Larson.</p>
            
            <p>Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist Steve Bell in his strip in The Guardian newspaper,
            particularly during and following the Falklands War, and the well-known Opus the Penguin, from the cartoons of Berkeley
            Breathed, is also described as hailing from the Falklands. Opus was a comical, "existentialist" penguin character in the
            cartoons Bloom County, Outland and Opus. He was also the star in the Christmas show A Wish for Wings That Work.</p>
            
            <p>In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting homosexual couples. A
            children's book, And Tango Makes Three, was written about one such penguin family in the New York Zoo.</p>
