            <p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates,
            such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the
            temperate zone;[55] one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made
            possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands.[56] Also, though
            the climate of North Pole and South Pole is similar, there are no penguins found in the North Pole.[57]
            
            Several authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of Bergmann's Rule[58][59] where larger bodied
            populations live at higher latitudes than smaller bodied populations. There is some disagreement about this, and several
            other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents
            and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone.[60][61]
            
            Major populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and
            South Africa.[62][63] Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of two million in France's remote
            Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science.[64]</p>
