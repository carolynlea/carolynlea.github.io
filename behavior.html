            <h2>Breeding</h2>
            
            <p>Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and Fiordland species; these
            colonies may range in size from as few as a 100 pairs for gentoo penguins, to several hundred thousand in the case of
            king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins.[65] Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between
            birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all penguin species.[66] Agonistic
            displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other
            individuals.[66]</p>
            
            <p>Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most
            penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the king penguins, lay only
            one.[67] With the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins share the incubation
            duties.[68] These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.</p>
            
            <p>Penguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the little penguin, which can raise two or three broods in a
            season.[69]</p>
            
            <p>Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at
            52 g (2 oz), the little penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450 g (1 lb) emperor penguin egg is
            2.3%.[67] The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to reduce the
            effects of dehydration and to minimize the risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment.[70] The yolk, too, is
            large, and comprises 22–31% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain the
            chick if the parents are delayed in returning with food.[71]</p>
            
            <p>When emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to "steal" another mother's chick, usually
            unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick.[citation needed] In
            some species, such as king and emperor penguins, the chicks assemble in large groups called crèches.</p>
