        <p>Penguins (order <em>Sphenisciformes</em>, family <em>Spheniscidae</em>) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost
        exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly
        adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into
        flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming
        underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.</p>
    
        <p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates,
        such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate
        zone, and one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, lives near the equator.</p>
    
        <p>The largest living species is the emperor penguin (<em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>): on average, adults are about 1.1 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (3 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr> 7
        <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) tall and weigh 35 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (77 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), also known
        as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (16 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) tall and weighs 1 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (2.2 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). Among extant penguins, larger
        penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see
        also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human.
        These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at
        least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr> south of the equator 35 <abbr title="million years ago">mya</abbr>, in a climate decidedly warmer
        than today.</p>
