            <p>Penguins (order <em>Sphenisciformes</em>, family <em>Spheniscidae</em>) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost
            exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos_penguin">Galapagos penguin</a>, found north of the equator. Highly
            adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into
            flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming
            underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.</p>
        
            <p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates,
            such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate
            zone, and one species, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galapagos_penguin">Galápagos penguin</a>, lives near the equator.</p>
        
            <p>The largest living species is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_penguin">emperor penguin</a> (<em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>): on average, adults are about 1.1 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (3 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr> 7
            <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) tall and weigh 35 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (77 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). The smallest penguin species is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_penguin">little blue penguin</a> (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), also known
            as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (16 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) tall and weighs 1 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (2.2 <abbr title="pounds">lb</abbr>). Among extant penguins, larger
            penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see
            also Bergmann's rule). <b>Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes,</b> becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human.
            These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at
            least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr> south of the equator 35 <abbr title="million years ago">mya</abbr>, in a climate decidedly warmer
            than today.</p>
